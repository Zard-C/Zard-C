### Hi, I am [Zard-C](https://github.com/Zard-C)👋

🌱 I'm a developer passionate about [ROS2](https://github.com/ros2).

💼 Currently working at [Mach-Drive](http://www.mach-drive.com/) as a software engineer.

 🔭 I'm currently diving deep into [rcl](https://github.com/ros2/rcl) and [rmw_fastrtps](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps)
  
📫 You can reach out to me at [📧 patrick.zhang5233@gmail.com].

🔍 Here, you'll find the projects I'm involved in, the code I write, and my thoughts on technology.

- An utility that helps me swap endian [EndianSwapUtility](https://github.com/Zard-C/EndianSwapUtility)
- The notes of Programming Paradigms [CS107Notes](https://zard-c.github.io/CS107/)
- I'm also a contributor to [ROS2/rclc](https://github.com/ros2/rclc), which is an awesome project that provides a ROS2 client library for C applications.
- Here's some demo codes of `rclc` [rclc_examples](https://github.com/Zard-C/rclc_example), which is a complement to `rclc/examples`.

📖 I believe in lifelong learning and sharing, so I often share my knowledge on github pages [🚀](https://zard-c.github.io/CS107/)
